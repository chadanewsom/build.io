RubyCocoa - A Ruby/Objective-C Bridge
=====================================

RubyCocoa is a Mac OS X framework that allows Cocoa programming in the
object-oriented scripting language [Ruby][1]. In other words, it is a bridge
that let you access Objective-C objects from Ruby, and vice-versa.

Please visit the RubyCocoa Web Site http://rubycocoa.github.io/ to get
more information.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Mac OS X 10.6 or higher
- Ruby 1.8.7, 2.0 or higher

If you overwrote Apple's Ruby with a custom version, please make sure that it
has been built with --enabled-shared.
